# BigDataFinal

# Overview:

This project investigates the accessibility of cruelty-free makeup on top cosmetic and beauty websites and compares the brands on these websites against cruelty-free product databases. By comparing the cruelty-free products from verified cosmetic brands with the total number of brands listed on cruelty-free websites, this project aims to evaluate the accuracy of cruelty-free databases. In order to conduct this research,  web scraping was required to collect data from databases such as PETA and Logical Harmony. This data was then cross-referenced with information from popular cosmetic and beauty websites.

The analysis focuses on creating visual representations of this data, including bar graphs and pie charts, to effectively present the findings. These visualisations allow for a comprehensive comparison between the number of cruelty-free brands and the total brand count on each website. Additionally, the study highlights discrepancies between the databases and the collected website data, providing insights into the reliability of the information.

Findings from this research highlight the beauty industry's commitment to animal testing. The study also discusses the limitations of web scraping and potential sources of error, aiming to provide recommendations for improving the accuracy of cruelty-free databases.

Building upon this research, the project's final design aims to create a unique cosmetic product that visually displays and compares data related to cruelty-free brands. By using colour and logos, the final product provides a clear representation of which beauty brands are making an effort to sell cruelty-free makeup. This integration of cosmetics and data visualisation aims to raise awareness about cruelty-free options and empower consumers to make more informed, ethical choices.

Throughout the project, documentation will showcase the research process, data collection and analysis methods, visual representations of the findings, and reflections on the implications for the beauty industry and animal welfare.
